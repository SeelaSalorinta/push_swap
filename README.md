# 🔢 push_swap – Sorting With Style (and Stacks)

For my seventh project at Hive Helsinki, I tackled push_swap, a sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks and a limited set of operations. 🏗️

At the start:

    Stack A holds a random set of unique numbers (positive and negative).

    Stack B is empty.

    The goal? Sort Stack A in ascending order using the fewest moves possible! 🏆

To do this, I could only use a set of predefined operations:
🔄 Swaps: sa, sb, ss (swap top elements)
📤 Pushes: pa, pb (move elements between stacks)
🔄 Rotations: ra, rb, rr (shift elements up)
🔄 Reverse Rotations: rra, rrb, rrr (shift elements down)

The program outputs the smallest possible list of instructions needed to sort Stack A, with each instruction printed on a new line. 📜

To make sure everything worked, we used a checker that verified whether our moves resulted in a properly sorted stack. ✅

For max points:

    100 numbers sorted in 700 moves or less

    500 numbers sorted in 5500 moves or less

🚀 This project was a huge logic and algorithm challenge, but incredibly fun!
